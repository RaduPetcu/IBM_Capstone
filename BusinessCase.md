# Il Carnicero (steakhouse) from Milan - Ibiza and now New York


Background and Business Problem Statement

I was having dinner at my favorite Steakhouse in Milan (El Carnicero) and i met the owner of that restaurant.
We started to talk and he told me that he already opened another restaurant 2 years ago in Ibiza and now he wants to expand also in the United States of America - New York.
He is very curious about the steakhouse market in New York and he is very curious what is the best neighbourhood to open his new restaurant. 
As he knows that he has a very good restaurant he is searching to open near other stakehouses as he knows that his receipes are highly competitive.

His question is:

"What neighborhood in NYC would be the best fit for opening up a steaknouse shop based on the places already freqvented by other "meat lovers".
