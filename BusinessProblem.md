# Buying a house in Milan: did i make the right choice?

Long story short! In the last few months i was searching for a house in Milan because i don't want to pay any rent. Two month ago i found a house that i liked in an area, but when i decided to buy it the real estate agency told me that the house is not available anymore. I started to search again i found another house that i like and now i am in the  process of buying it. The issue is: did i make the right choice? 
I will try comparing the prices per square meter in the different areas, number of services taking a 1 mile range, and the distance from my work :)
